My name is Weronica Green. I am currently a Data Scientist at [Lemonade](https://www.lemonade.com/) working on Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects. Here I design, build, and deploy various machine learning models end-to-end. These models focus on problems related to risk/fraud and pricing. I am also working on Computer Vision projects.  

I completed a Master in Science in Data Science from the University of San Francisco. I also have my Undergraduate Degree in Business Administration from Brooklyn College.

Outside of work, I am an active hiker, ex-national team basketball player, and passionate baker.
